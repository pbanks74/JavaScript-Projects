# JavaScript-Projects

The Tech Academy's JavaScript course taught me functions, loops, variables, naming conventions and data types.  These are some projects I created utilizing JavaScript.

## Projects

* [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/pbanks74/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Pizza_Project/Pizza.html)
* [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/pbanks74/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.html)
* [Calculator](https://github.com/pbanks74/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Calculator/calculator.html)

### Pizza Menu
A pizza menu that allows for various sizes and toppings to be selected and then calculates a price. Menu was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Classic Tic-Tac-Toe with a twist! Rather than X's and O's you play with trees and fire taking turns until theres a winner. Upon winning, the game restarts. Game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Calculator
Basic calculator that allows a user to add, subtract, multiply and divide on a colorful interface. Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Conclusion
The JavaScript course, like the HTML and CSS course, will further provide the basic foundation going forward. I can now feel confident in utilizing functions, loops and conditional statements to create or enhance programs in the future.
